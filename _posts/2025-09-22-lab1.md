Using a dataset containing data about all of the digimon, I was tasked with completing the following tasks 

1.  Finding the average speed of all of the Digimon

2.  Writing a function that could count the number of Digimon with a specific attribute. For example, count_digimon("Type", "Vaccine") would return 70.

3.  Finding a team of up to 3 digimon such that their combined Atk values were greater than 300 and combined Memory values less than 15.

4.  (For extra credit) writing a function similar to count_digimon, but, this one would count the number of digimon with a numeric value between a min and max value.

In this article, I describe my answers and process in finding them.

For the first question, when parsing through the data, I would count the total speed of all of the Digimon while also counting the number of Digimon. Then, I would divide the total speed by the number of digimon to get the average speed. The average speed was roughly 120.4.

For the second question, the function was rather uninteresting:


This code cycles through all of the rows in the data table, cycling through each value in the row. Since we use a DictReader for parsing the data, each row is stored as a Dictionary
