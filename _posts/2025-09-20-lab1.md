Using a dataset containing data about all of the digimon, I was tasked with completing the following tasks 



In this article, I describe my answers and process in finding them.

For the first question, when parsing through the data, I would count the total speed of all of the Digimon while also counting the number of Digimon. Then, I would divide the total speed by the number of digimon to get the average speed. The average speed was roughly 120.4.

For the second question, the function was rather uninteresting:
```python
def count_digimon(attr,val): # Returns the number of digimon that have a certain value for a particular attribute using attr_count
    try:
        return attr_count[attr][val]
    except:
        return 0
```

All that this function does is take a value from a nested dictionary. The most important part of the function is just the attr_count dictionary.
```python

attr_count = {} #Stores the amount of each value of each attribute

with open("digimon.csv","r") as f:
    data = csv.DictReader(f)
    for row in data:
        for key in row.keys():
            if key not in attr_count.keys():
                attr_count[key] = {}
            if row[key] not in attr_count[key].keys():
                attr_count[key][row[key]] = 0
            attr_count[key][row[key]] += 1
 

```

This code cycles through all of the rows in the data table, cycling through each value in the row. Since we use a DictReader for parsing the data, each row is stored as a Dictionary
